# Pong Game

This is a sub-par version of 1-player pong where(If you couldn't already tell) you get a point for the ball hitting bar and the speed is completely random. Also you die if the ball hits the bottom. Also sometimes it'll spawn kill you so just refresh the page. To move the bar use the arrow keys.

Drag the file into chrome to launch the game.
